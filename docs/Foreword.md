# Foreword

Since I was a child in the primary school, I always had a great passion for hacking electronics. My mother taught me how to use the basic tools like the screwdriver and a giant soldering gun that I used to do my own audio cables. But beyond the basics, I didn't have any opportunity to understand how electronic works. Even at the amatorial level, it was hard to discover the secrets of the electronics alone. At that time, there was no Internet and the books I could find were too advanced for a child to understand the basics without a teacher.

Later on, my father gave me a Sinclair ZX81 which appeared mind-blowing to me. Given the total absence of commercial software, I self-taught the BASIC programming language just trying all the available instructions. I discovered my software programming passion which never kicked away the passion for electronics. I started interfacing the ZX81 first and later on the Sinclair Spectrum using the serial port with a printer and my passion grew exponentially.

I had many other similar experiences but I was always aware of the fact that self-teaching was not the right way. In the primary school I already knew inside of me that I really wanted to be an Engineer. I wrote about this profession in a short essay and my parents still remember it.

Right after my graduation, I was already pretty good and confident in software programming but still very weak in electronics. I was aware I could have a slightly easier life at the University by choosing Computer Engineering instead of Electronics Engineering, but my goal was different. I really wanted to deeply learn electronics and understanding all the theory that was behind the things I hacked since I was a child.

In the eighties, the Engineering University in Genoa was definitely hard but also very valuable. Hundreds of students in very large rooms with zero audio amplification, long queues to enter the university at 6 am in the morning and anybody after the 10th row had small chances to hear the professor voice. In these years I was leaving alone in my parents' house because they went abroad for work. But I did it, I passed the majority of the most difficult exams and entered the last three years.

In the meanwhile, my software skills were growing over time. While studying, I fully embraced the "8088" PC learning its assembly code, programming in C and also the "experimental language" C++, fully embracing the object orientation. I wrote a software for a very popular digitizer (which is now in a computer museum in the Verona University), migrated an Amiga video-game to the PC 80286 and wrote "Terminate and Stay Resident" interrupt-based programs for the PC. I did amazing discoveries and made a lot of experiences which determined a solid personal growth which still have a great value in my current work.

One exam was extremely long but special. Other two students and I decided to write a book for the "**Elettronica Applicata**" course with Professor Alessandro Chiabrera. Writing in LaTex with lots of formulas and drawing all the graphs was dramatic and resulted in 670 pages of small-sized font book. I remember Professor Chiabrera lessons in my heart. He had an incredible passion for the "bio" future of electronics and I was deeply saddened when I later knew he was passed away.

My life was split between writing software and studying. I totally disrupted my days and nights. I used to spend night and days either writing software at home or in the DIBE laboratories to learn electronics and work on my exams. I used to spend far more than anyone else in the DIBE building discussing with Professors Parodi, Donzellini, Bisio and many others on an incredibly large number of awesome topics.

I was not too far from finishing my university dream when an incredible working opportunity knocked at my door. I talked with some of the professors, and they talked to me not as professors but as they were my parents. They were very sad for me leaving the university and warned me that coming back later was a "mission-impossible". <u>They were absolutely right</u>. I got a marvelous wife and two children, we worked hard for our house and meanwhile the time passes fighting all the daily battles that adult life presents and challenges.

Over the years, I always told to myself I was blessed to have had the opportunity to work in my life with the things I dreamed of, since I was a child. As a consultant, I had the opportunity to work in many different industries. I became an instructor in training courses first, and later a speaker in international conferences. Over this time, since 2003 Microsoft every year evaluates and recognizes me the special MVP (Most Valuable Professional) Award in security and developer technologies. I spent an incredibly amount of astonishing and rewarding years fulfilling a lot of my dreams, but my very first was still missing.

Over the years I did find some time to pass one exam, then another one but the required amount of time was not sufficient to finish my studies. I was busy with my work, travels, and of course studying which is mandatory for anyone, but absolutely necessary for anyone working in the software industry.

Even if I had an incredible professional software career, I still spend some of my spare time in my personal electronics lab where I have professional tools like air soldering, 3D microscope for SMD-sized components, 3D printer, oscilloscopes and a spectrum analyzer which I also used to prepare the "Comunicazioni Elettriche" exam few months ago. As I always did, I need to study, observe and understand to make the topic mine.

The recent pandemic had a tragic balance but gave me the opportunity to use the spare-time to focus on my last seven exams. Initially I was scared not to be able to ride again my math as everybody is able to do with bicycles. Despite that, I was able to pass the most scaring exams with the highest scores, which is a solid proof that my studying abilities has grown over the years. Studying is for me what the adrenaline is for a professional sportsman.

I am a professional software guy but with a profound passion for electronics. Choosing the topic for my thesis was not an easy task. I really wanted to choose something innovative and providing a concrete help. Since my whole experience is in software, I decided for an ambitious topic.

My thesis aims to provide a concrete answer to the versioning issues in distributed services. This is something that a lot of my customers faced and could not resolve easily or completely. I already presented the Semantic Driven Modeling idea to 5 international conferences, received a lot of feedback from attendees and colleagues, discussed in a conference panel with illustrious architects working for well-known leading cloud-providers.

Semantic Driven Modeling is not just a theory. I wrote about 15'000 lines of .NET code implementing all the required algorithms and tools to provide a concrete solution. The code makes use of the most advanced software techniques such as the creation of a new, simple Domain Specific Language and dynamically generated code. Furthermore, it fully respects REST principles and the overall micro-benchmarks demonstrate it is extremely efficient.

Even if this is just the short version of my university travel, it may be enough to explain why I want to dedicate my master degree in Electronic Engineering to myself and my university.

This is not a finish line, I will continue hacking in software and hardware as I always did.
