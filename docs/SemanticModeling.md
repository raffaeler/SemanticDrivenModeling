# Semantic Modeling

A semantic model describes all the conceptual characteristics that are needed to understand the nature of a model in a specific domain.

* 



* naming conventions => terms, glossary, labels
* relationships
  * No need to describe a 1-1 or 1-many relationship as they can be derived from the incoming data model
* behaviors



### Differences with OWL / RDF

1. Restrict to specific domains instead of pretending to be omniscient

2. On a service boundary a model just carry information, not behaviors

   Instead, service calls determine the behavior of a service

3.
